## Logo Usage

The different-colored logos are used differently across the ecosystem, and it is important to make sure that they are used consistently.

LOGO                                            | TITLE         | DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------
![R5 Logo](png/r5_logo-white-black-bg.png)      | **R5 Logo**       | Main logo used to represent the broader ecosystem and protocol.
![R5 Labs](png/r5.labs-logo-teal-black-bg.png)  | **R5 Labs**       | R5 Labs logo. Should only be used to reference R5 Labs, and not the R5 Network, or any of its other initiatives.
![Community](png/community_logo-deep-blue-bg.png)  | **Community**       | The colorful R5 logo represents its diverse and dynamic community. You should use this logo whenever referencing community forums, servers, or initiatives.
![Yellow pages](png/yellow-pages_logo-yellow-bg.png)  | **Yellow Pages**       | This logo should be used when referencing to the Yellow Pages initiative. To preserve its visual identity, it is not recommended using this logo with a transparent background.
![R5 Coin](png/r5_coin.png)  | **R5 Coin**       | The R5 coin logo. It should always be used with a transparent backgorund to make the round shape evident - resemblant of that of a coin. If it's not possible or feasible to use a transparent background, we recommend using the plain white logo with a #459381 background.

## Color Schemes

## Fonts

The primary font family used by R5 is **Red Hat Display**. We strongly recommend its usage whenever possible. As alternatives, when it is not possible to use the primary font family, we recommend the usage of the **Montserrat** font family for regular texts, and **Roboto Mono** for mono-spaced text. All fonts are available inside the `/font` folder.
